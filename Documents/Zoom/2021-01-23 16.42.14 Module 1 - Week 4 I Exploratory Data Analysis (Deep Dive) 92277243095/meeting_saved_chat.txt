14:27:58 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : I was going to say, I had to go through the arduous process of getting python and libraries up and running on the m1 Mac. So if anyone needs any tips or help with that, I‚Äôve done it.
14:30:28 From Rajib Kumar Das to Everyone : @Jordan‚Ä¶can we run the python codes in McBook Air M1‚Ä¶.?
14:32:43 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : Yes, but there is a lot of incompatibilities because of it being an ARM processor. I am running Miniforge for ARM which works alright, and it has ARM versions for all of the libraries I need. But Anaconda does not work. And Jupiter notebooks doesn‚Äôt work without doing a bunch of tweaking.
14:33:24 From Rajib Kumar Das to Everyone : Wow!
14:33:42 From Rajib Kumar Das to Everyone : Hopefully Anaconda comes with a new version soon
