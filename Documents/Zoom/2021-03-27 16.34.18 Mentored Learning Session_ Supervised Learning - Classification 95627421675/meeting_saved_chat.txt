15:04:22 From Scott Roskilly to Everyone : Sorry couple minutes late here!
16:26:41 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : Log transformation and outlier treatment are two different things.. transformations are for normality
16:27:48 From Shane McMillan to Everyone : still don't quite understand why log transformation is important for model building - ie why does it have to be normally distributed
16:28:04 From Shane McMillan to Everyone : it = data = dependent variable
16:28:13 From Rajib Kumar Das to Everyone : That was what I thought…log transformation for normality and viewing the data
16:28:55 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : The residuals of the regression need to be normally distributed - that is an assumption of the model
16:29:49 From Jason E Hewitt to Everyone : Thanks Jordan
16:31:23 From Shane McMillan to Everyone : what is the actual math function of the log transformation of the data = looking for a formula online but only came across generic log functions
16:32:05 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : np.log(data). Just takes the natural logarithm
16:32:54 From Riddhi Bhatt to Everyone : You need to do a +1 if there are negative values.
16:33:07 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : There’s another google transformer out there called the Box-Cox transformation. Look into that also. That can be very useful
16:33:16 From Jordan Rich to Everyone : Good, not google
